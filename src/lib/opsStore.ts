/* ============================================================================
 * opsStore — the single, synchronous source-of-truth for the clinic's live
 * operations (admissions = medical cases + boarding, plus the pets they belong
 * to). A tiny module-level pub/sub cache layered over the dual-adapter `repo`:
 *
 *   • Registration (New Case) writes through `addCase` → the pet's card is
 *     injected into the cache the instant it's persisted, so the التقويم الرئيسي
 *     shows it with ZERO fetch/flicker and no page reload.
 *   • The calendar's drag-and-drop writes through `patch` → optimistic update
 *     now, Supabase UPDATE in the background, revert on failure.
 *   • Any consumer (the calendar) subscribes and re-renders on every change.
 *
 * The cache survives route changes (module singleton), so a case registered on
 * /new-case is already present when /reception mounts. `hydrate` re-pulls from
 * the repo on mount, so writes made elsewhere (e.g. the patient profile) are
 * reconciled — one unified model, no disconnect. Deliberately framework-light:
 * plain state + a Set of listeners, NOT TanStack Query.
